Mastering github
github is a recommended prerequisite of sorts for mastering Visual Studio Code IDE.  It is one of those key support technologies that , increasingly, one has to deal with when one does anything technological.  Also, oddly I have always had more difficulty with the support technologies that I have ever had writing code.  For a while I will major in GitHub, and Visual Studio Code and then I will dive back in to Python.
